# CSV Rainfall Parser

* Assume current culture would be current culture

* Assumed to just hold the data in memory for this example using simple Lists with the class types defined based on device and readings.

* Assumption for this example just to load the program and parse the data to show the information.

* Made assumption to check the rainfall trend if its going up or down would be a simple comparison agains the last previous 4 hour periodas an indicator.

* ConsoleColor.DarkYellow looks amber to me so assumed ok to use that colour.

* Assumption just to read in the devices and show them , not worried about sorting in this example.
